COMP 472 Project Deliverable 1:
- To run the game, you need the Unity editor
- If Unity editor is not available:
--> You can run the .exe file which contains the game
--> You can access the code with Visual Studio
---> If VS is not available, any text editor should show the code

Comments:
- Parts of code commented out are for the next deliverables, they require additional testing
